1.absolute difference between the current parameters and the saved parameters is calculted as follows:
		*Each array elements change value is added/ total number of elemements.
2. return the max change among initalMastery,Learn,Slip,Guess.		
3.KCs are listed as integers.
4.Filling algo -> For A from 1 to Last[S]-1   is iterated from 1 to Last[S]
5. Kcs start from 0 to n-1
6. Attempts - first attempt is at 0th index.
7.Question - 01234567....n-1
8. Learn -> Learn[K] = min(1, max(0, LearnNumerator / LearnDenominator))  changed to -> Learn[K] = min(0.5, max(0.05, LearnNumerator / LearnDenominator)) to avoid learn changing to 0 or 1
